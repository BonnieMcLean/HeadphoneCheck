HeadphoneCheck.js:
	- two exposed variables: number of examples that you want to show up on a given page, and debug flag
	- two exposed functions: one for loading stimuli from a json file, one for rendering an HTML page
	- call the load examples function and then render the first page of the headphone check (with #examplesPerPage on this page)

	-page rendering calls a function which renders individual stimuli on the page

TODO:
  # 6-15-2017
  - calibration sound should be configurable
  - Put example sounds on AWS S3
  - Sample with replacement
  - handle ajax error
  - random with replacement

  - fire events on all major state changes (in parenthesis means not required)
    + overall begin/end
    + stim json success/fail
    + calibration begin/end
    + headphone check begin/end
    + (renderHTMLPage with pageNum data)
    + (per trial rendering seems like overkill)

  - fine grained detail of response per trial
  - local storage progress caching
    + we need to track per trial responses and playback status (probably easier than infering from disabled button states)

  - refactor all callback and event binding to single function? it's pretty messy as it is
  - do we need a more fine grained warning/feedback system?
  - check playback counters if `requirePlayback` is false
  - support for multiple audio sources
  - fix audio source type
  - json schema -> what if IDs aren't unique?
  - render finished page?
