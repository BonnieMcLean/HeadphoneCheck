HeadphoneCheck.js:
	- two exposed variables: number of examples that you want to show up on a given page, and debug flag
	- two exposed functions: one for loading stimuli from a json file, one for rendering an HTML page
	- call the load examples function and then render the first page of the headphone check (with #examplesPerPage on this page)

	-page rendering calls a function which renders individual stimuli on the page

TODO:
  - refactor all callback and event binding to single function? it's pretty messy as it is
  - do we need a more fine grained warning/feedback system?
  - check playback counters if `requirePlayback` is false
  - support for multiple audio sources
  - fix audio source type
  - json schema -> what if IDs aren't unique?
  - render finished page?
