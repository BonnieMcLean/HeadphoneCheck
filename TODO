README/TODO

HeadphoneCheck.js:
	- two exposed variables: number of examples that you want to show up on a given page, and debug flag
	- two exposed functions: one for loading stimuli from a json file, one for rendering an HTML page
	- call the load examples function and then render the first page of the headphone check (with #examplesPerPage on this page)

	-page rendering calls a function which renders individual stimuli on the page

TODO:
  - Clean up indentation and names
  - radio button in div styling
  - page handling
  - remove jquery ui
	- it's not actually updating the page correctly because i'm not refreshing the html page to remove all the div elements?
	- the buttons look wacky because the divs aren't stacking vertically properly
	- change indentation/collapse stuff (ray)
